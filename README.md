## Sketch Plugins

No common theme, just a few [Sketch](http://bohemiancoding.com/sketch/) plugins I've created and found to be useful. Head to the repos and click `Download ZIP`, or clone the git repository with `git clone..` in Terminal, to get them.

* [Cover Artboard](https://github.com/sebj/Cover-Artboard)
* [Invert Background Color](https://github.com/sebj/Invert-Background-Color)
* [Remove Fills and Borders](https://github.com/sebj/Remove-Fills-and-Borders)
* [Rename Selected Layers](https://github.com/sebj/Rename-Layers)
* [Setup .iconset Artboards](https://github.com/sebj/Setup-Iconset-Artboards)
